						Gentoo was founded over a socially distanced coffee by Andy and
						Chris. Following a decade plus career in IT and distribution they
						decided that there was a gap in the market for an exciting and
						nimble retailer selling solutions that improve everyday life.
						<br />
						<br /> We focus on clever design-lead products, which are frequently
						funky, and we hope you agree are always interesting. <br />
						<br />
						We hope you enjoy our selection and if you have feedback or a
						challenge that we might be able to find a solution for, weâ€™d love to
						hear from you: sales@gen-too.co.uk
